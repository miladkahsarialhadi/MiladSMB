# Milad SMB Client 

Server Message Block (SMB) is a communication protocol for providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports between nodes on a network. It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication mechanism. Server Message Block provides file sharing, network browsing, printing services, and interprocess communication over a network. The SMB protocol relies on lower-level protocols for transport. 

The SMB Inter-Process Communication (IPC) system provides named pipes and was one of the first inter-process mechanisms commonly available to programmers that provides a means for services to inherit the authentication carried out when a client first connects to an SMB server. SMB serves as the basis for Microsoft's Distributed File System implementation. However, with this library software developers can work with SMB/CIFS based path and shared directory easily.
